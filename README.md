## üìã Project Overview

Food Delivery Delay Prediction is a comprehensive data science solution designed to help restaurants and delivery services optimize their operations by accurately predicting delivery times and potential delays. Using real-world factors such as distance, traffic conditions, weather, preparation time, and vehicle type, our system provides actionable insights to improve on-time delivery performance and enhance customer satisfaction.

This project was developed as part of the Buildables Data Science Fellowship by a three-member team, demonstrating a complete machine learning pipeline from data exploration to model deployment.
