# FoodDeliveryDelayPrediction
Peer project for Buildables Data Science Fellowship. We are a 3-member team working on predicting food delivery delays using real-world factors like distance, traffic, weather, and prep time. The project applies EDA, feature engineering, and ML to help restaurants improve on-time delivery.
